# food_delivery

This is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of food ordering and event registration within a campus or organizational environment. Built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express and MongoDB on the backend, the app allows users to browse items, add them to a cart, and place orders with delivery details. It features a secure login system, dynamic cart management, order history, and admin order tracking. A key highlight is the smooth checkout experience â€” now enhanced with a simulated payment system, real-time order animations (like celebratory crackers), and automatic cart reset after a successful order. The project aims to offer an intuitive and visually appealing interface for both users and admins, making it ideal for tech fests, college events, or any club-based ordering system.
